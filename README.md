# caiorulli.github.io

Development project for generating the assets for my [personal site](https://caiorulli.github.io).

It has a handful of Clojure tools for static sites:
- [stasis](https://github.com/magnars/stasis) for static page serving utils;
- [hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) for building HTML;
- [garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) for building CSS.

## Usage

To run the project with stasis' live-reload:
```bash
lein ring server-headless
```
It will start at `localhost:3000` by default.

To build it into the `caiorulli.github.io` submodule, run:
```bash
lein build-site
```
